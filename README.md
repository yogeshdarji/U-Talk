Now no more typing, no data pack, no more confusion Just a call, can solve all your problems.Events in your University, Near by you, Sports, Weather, News Everyone hates to search about events, just a call will tell you what all events are there nearby you. Created an IVR based system which constitutes an interactive system which takes inputs from user and gives related updates at Hack-a-thon HackDFW.  

## Inspiration
When we are in college, we know there are lots of events going on. Say i have a break of 1 hour between my 2 classes and I have some free time where i can attend some event going on in campus. Searching about events is always a an overhead. Sometimes search is slow, unavailability of connectivity and may such problems. To overcome this problem, we came up with an idea of getting to know information about events by a phone call.

## What it does
Whether events, weather, sports, news, you say, you get all the information at the fingertips
